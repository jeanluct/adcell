* Make +adcell subfolder.

* Increase max before complaining about lack of MEX file?

* Rename functions to adcell.setp, etc. syntax.

* Add 'isempty' option for default arguments.

* Make private folder?  But I think right now all the functions are
  used.

* 'examples' folder?

* Help messages!

* Write adcell.effdiff function.  Returns Deff and optional chi.
  Compare to large-D limiting form.

* To get ready for eventual distribution:

  * Add LICENSE and COPYING.  GPL v3 ok?  MIT to agree with *jlt lib*?

  * Add boilerplate to m-files.

  * Don't forget to credit `fourdif` aurhors.  No license?
