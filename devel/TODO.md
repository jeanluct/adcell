* Include `lecture28.tex` writeup as a doc?

% Allow nonsquare grid.  Need to change unpk, and allows for [Lx Ly]
  and [k1x k1y].

* Make `private` folder?  But I think right now all the functions are
  used.  Function to return k vectors?  (Add to jlt.)

* Check sign of u.  The operator should be -u.grad?

* Laplacian function to return diffusive part only.  This is useful so
  we can make many Ak's for different diffusivities with recomputing
  u.grad.

* Check help messages.

* In `adcell.effdiff`: improve help message.  Compare to large-D
  limiting form.
