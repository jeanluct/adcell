How to use the Matlab code for solving the advection-diffusion
equation of an autonomous flow:

INSTALLATION

- In the directory where you want to work, unzip adcell.zip.
  Under UNIX this means 'unzip adcell.zip'.

- After starting Matlab, cd to the directory where you unzipped the
  files.  Then run `mex fft2udotgrad_helper.c' within Matlab.  This
  will compile a helper function for filling the sparse matrix of the
  Fourier-space operator u.grad in the advection-diffusion equation.

You're now ready to run the program!

RUNNING

- Run adcell_run('1').  The argument specifies which flow and set of
  parameter values are used.

- You can add your own run parameters by adding a case in the switch
  statement at the top of adcell_run: you can specify the diffusion
  coefficient (effectively the inverse Peclet number) and the number
  of Fourier coefficients in each dimension.  N should be made larger
  as Diff is decreased.  Another useful parameter is ks, which
  determines how many cells fill the domain.  For ks=4, there will
  seem to be 8 cells in each direction, since they come in pairs.
